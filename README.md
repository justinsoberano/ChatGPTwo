# ChatGPTwo

A terminal program that lets you create your own personal chatbot A.I. Made during spring break to see how far I can push GPT-3.5.

### Execute
Executing the program will ask the user to enter an API key for the very first time. It will then proceed and ask questions to form a chatbot A.I.
